# stat_string 
# this function takes summary output from addBf_ranges3 and the name of a coefficient from that summary and formats so that can be reported as a string in the main text.  Default is to round all stats to 2pd, apart from p values which are rounded to 3dp (as per APA format)). Beta, SE, z p, Bayes factor (with (0,H1) as a subscript, where H1 is the predicted of H1) and Robustness regions are all reported
#note that as this stands, if the ranges are strings (e.g. ">4.5") they won't be rounded
